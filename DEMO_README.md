# Advanced GPU Font Renderer - Text Block Word Wrap Demo

A high-performance GPU-based text rendering system built for text editors, featuring advanced word wrapping and instanced rendering capabilities.

## 🚀 Overview

This project demonstrates an advanced GPU font rendering system that uses WebGPU's instanced drawing capabilities to efficiently render thousands of characters with minimal draw calls. The system is specifically designed as a foundation for text editors with sophisticated text layout requirements.

## ✨ Features

### Core Rendering System
- **Instanced GPU Rendering**: Each glyph is rendered as a separate instance, allowing for thousands of characters with optimal performance
- **Advanced WGSL Shaders**: Multiple shader variants optimized for different rendering scenarios
- **Flexible Pipeline Architecture**: Modular design supporting various text effects and rendering modes

### Text Layout Engine
- **Automatic Word Wrapping**: Intelligent line breaking at word boundaries
- **Configurable Text Metrics**: Customizable character dimensions, line height, and spacing
- **Responsive Layout**: Adapts to different viewport sizes and constraints
- **Multi-line Text Blocks**: Support for complex document layouts

### Shader System
- **Vertex Shader**: Advanced instanced rendering with viewport transformations and scrolling
- **Fragment Shader Variants**:
  - Basic fragment shader for font atlas sampling
  - Solid color shader for testing and debugging
  - Production font atlas shader with SDF support
  - Effects shader with outline and shadow capabilities

```

## 🎮 Running the Demo

### Standalone Demo (Recommended)
```bash
julia --project=. standalone_demo.jl
```

This runs a comprehensive demonstration showing:
- Word wrapping with different viewport sizes
- Text layout analysis and metrics
- Glyph instance generation
- Various text scenarios and edge cases

### Word Wrap Testing
```bash
julia --project=. test_wrap.jl
```

Simple test of the word wrapping algorithm with different line widths.

## 🛠 Technical Architecture

### Glyph Instance Structure
Each character is represented as a GPU instance with:
- **Position**: Screen coordinates (x, y)
- **Size**: Character dimensions (width, height)
- **UV Coordinates**: Font atlas texture coordinates
- **Color**: RGBA color information
- **Glyph Index**: Character identifier for effects

### Text Metrics System
Configurable text layout parameters:
- **Character Width**: Base character width for layout
- **Character Height**: Character height for bounds calculation
- **Line Height**: Vertical spacing between lines
- **Space Width**: Width of space characters

### Word Wrapping Algorithm
Intelligent text flow algorithm that:
1. Splits text into words
2. Calculates word widths based on character metrics
3. Breaks lines at word boundaries when width limits are exceeded
4. Maintains optimal readability and layout

## 📊 Performance Characteristics

### Rendering Performance
- **Instanced Drawing**: Single draw call for thousands of characters
- **GPU Acceleration**: All text positioning and effects handled on GPU
- **Minimal CPU Overhead**: Character layout pre-computed and buffered

### Memory Usage
- **Efficient Glyph Storage**: Compact instance data structure
- **Atlas Textures**: Shared font texture resources
- **Buffer Management**: Dynamic buffer resizing for text changes

## 🎯 Use Cases

### Text Editors
- **Syntax Highlighting**: Per-character color and effects
- **Large Documents**: Efficient rendering of thousands of lines
- **Real-time Editing**: Fast text updates and layout changes

### Code Editors
- **Monospace Fonts**: Optimized for programming text
- **Line Numbers**: Multi-column text layout support
- **Scrolling**: Smooth viewport transformations

### Document Viewers
- **Word Wrapping**: Automatic text reflow
- **Multi-font Support**: Different fonts and sizes
- **Rich Text**: Various text effects and styling

## 🚧 Future Enhancements

### Font System
- [ ] True font atlas generation from TTF/OTF files
- [ ] Multi-font support within single documents
- [ ] Font caching and management system

### Advanced Features
- [ ] Cursor positioning and text selection
